- AI.md contains AI-token-friendly documentation about Runner. Read it if the task implies that you know Runner.
- This package is multi-platform (readmes/MULTIPLATFORM.md) be sure to take this into account when implementing changes
- Node specific code goes under ./src/node/ folder. It is exported only for node.
