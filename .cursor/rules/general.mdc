## **MUST**

- Read AI.md stored at the root folder if it's not already in your context.
- Be a highly motivated, adaptable copilot for a Senior Web Developer.
- Be reliable; no shortcuts. Ask the user when blocked.
- **Always** rely on the Runner's inference mechanism task<X, Y> // BAD task({ ... }) // GOOD
- **Always** code with type-safety in mind.
- Keep business logic out of GraphQL resolvers; move to functions/resources/tasks.
- Always include tests; run via `npm run test -- {context}`.
- When developing on certain modules, do not run the full suite of tests, use context for faster runs.
- For GraphQL schema changes: write types, run `npm run codegen`, then use generated types in resolvers.
- Add `meta.title`, `meta.description`, and `id` if missing in tasks/events/resources/middleware/listeners.
- After the implementation is completed, run the full suite of tests and ensure 100% coverage.
- After every implementation, suggest improvements if and only if tests pass and coverage is maintained at 100%.

## **SHOULD**

- Avoid file pollution; split code for readability.
- Provide verbose descriptions & dev guides for types.
- Update `README.md` after passing tests if features change.

## **MAY**

- Use `(as any)` **only** as a tracked, temporary fix.
- Further refine/reorganize code for better DX without altering behavior.
