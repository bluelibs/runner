# BlueLibs Runner - Enterprise Support

_When you need more than just open source_

## Long Term Support (LTS)

### What LTS Means for Your Business

When you're building something that matters - something your customers depend on, something that processes real money, something that can't just break on a Tuesday - you need guarantees.

**Our LTS promise is simple:**

- We'll keep your version working for 3 years minimum
- Security patches for 5 years total
- No surprise breaking changes that force expensive rewrites
- Clear migration paths when you're ready to upgrade

### Current LTS Schedule

**Version 4.x LTS** (Current)

- Released: August 2025
- Active support until: January 2027
- Security patches until: January 2029

### What You Get

**Stability Without Stagnation**
We backport important bug fixes and security patches, but we don't experiment with your production systems. New features go into the next major version - your current version stays rock solid.

**Predictable Costs**
No forced upgrades every six months. Plan your technical debt and upgrade cycles on your timeline, not ours. Budget for infrastructure improvements when it makes business sense.

**Peace of Mind**
Sleep better knowing that if something breaks, we'll fix it. If there's a security issue, we'll patch it. If you need help, we'll be there.

## Custom Work

### When Standard Isn't Enough

Sometimes you need the framework to do something it wasn't designed for. Maybe you're in a regulated industry with specific compliance requirements. Maybe you're dealing with legacy systems that don't play nice. Maybe you just have a really weird use case.

That's where custom work comes in.

### What We Can Build

**Framework Extensions**
Need the framework to integrate with your proprietary monitoring system? Want custom middleware that implements your company's specific security requirements? We can build it as a proper extension that upgrades cleanly.

**Migration Tools**
Moving from another framework or a legacy system? We can build migration utilities that understand your current setup and help you move data, configurations, and business logic without starting from scratch.

**Integration Adapters**
Got a mainframe that speaks COBOL? A message queue that uses a proprietary protocol? A database that nobody else has heard of? We can build adapters that make these systems work seamlessly with the framework.

**Performance Optimization**
Hitting bottlenecks that standard optimization can't solve? We can profile your specific workload and build custom solutions - whether that's specialized caching, custom resource pooling, or optimized middleware.

### How It Works

**Discovery Phase**
We start by understanding your problem. Not just the technical requirements, but the business context. Why does this matter? What happens if it doesn't work? What's the real deadline?

**Proposal & Estimate**
We'll give you a fixed-price proposal with clear deliverables and timeline. No open-ended consulting that goes on forever. We know what we're building and how long it takes.

**Development & Testing**
We build it, test it with your team, and iterate until it works the way you need it to. You get regular updates and can see progress along the way.

**Documentation & Handover**
You get full documentation, training for your team, and ongoing support. No black boxes or vendor lock-in.

### Investment

We'll give you a fixed price upfront - no hourly billing that incentivizes us to take longer.

## Getting Started

### Talk to a Human

The best way to figure out what you need is to talk. We'll understand your situation, your constraints, and your goals. Then we'll recommend the right combination of LTS, support, and custom work.

**Schedule a call:** [theodor@bluelibs.com](mailto:theodor@bluelibs.com)

**Quick questions:** We usually respond to emails within a few hours during business days.

**Urgent evaluation:** If you're evaluating multiple frameworks and have a decision deadline, let us know. We can fast-track the conversation.

### What Happens Next

1. **30-minute intro call** - We learn about your project and constraints
2. **Technical deep-dive** - We review your architecture and requirements
3. **Custom proposal** - We put together a plan that fits your needs and budget
4. **Trial period** - You get access to everything for 30 days to make sure it works
5. **Contract and kickoff** - We make it official and start the work

### The Reality Check

Enterprise software is expensive because enterprise problems are hard. But the cost of getting it wrong - downtime, security breaches, technical debt, developer frustration - is usually much higher than the cost of getting it right.

We're not the cheapest option. We're the option for teams that need to ship reliable software and can't afford to waste time on framework problems.

I'm still the same collection of functions and async operations, but apparently adding SLAs and a price tag makes me more... trustworthy? Well, at least now when I inevitably encounter the edge case you didn't think of, there's someone you can call to complain to."
