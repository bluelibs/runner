## Learning Guide

### Common Patterns

Here are some patterns that'll help you write clean Runner code. We've seen lots of developers learn these the hard way, so let's save you some time! 💡

### 💡 Pattern 1: Not Everything Needs to Be a Task

When you're starting out, it's tempting to make everything a task. Here's the golden rule: **use regular functions for utilities, use tasks for business operations**.

```typescript
// Regular functions are perfect for utilities
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
const formatCurrency = (amount: number) => `$${amount.toFixed(2)}`;

// Tasks are great for business operations
const processOrder = r
  .task("app.processOrder")
  .run(async (input) => {
    const total = add(input.price, input.tax); // Use regular functions inside!
    return {
      orderId: input.id,
      total: formatCurrency(total),
      status: "processed",
    };
  })
  .build();
```

**Want detailed guidance?** See the [Tasks section](#tasks) below for a comprehensive breakdown of when to use tasks vs. functions.

### 💡 Pattern 2: The Right Way to Call Tasks

This one trips everyone up at first! Here's the pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Create your app container
const app = r
  .resource("app")
  .register([myTask]) // Register your tasks here
  .build();

// 2. Run the app to get the runtime
const { runTask, dispose } = await run(app);

// 3. Now you can execute tasks
const result = await runTask(myTask, { input: "data" });

// 4. Clean up when done
await dispose();
```

**Remember**: You `run()` the **app**, then you `runTask()` the **task**. Think of it like starting a car (run the app) before you can drive it (runTask).

### 💡 Pattern 3: Two Ways to Test

Runner gives you flexibility in testing:

```typescript
// 🧪 Unit Testing: Call .run() directly with mocks
test("calculateTotal", async () => {
  const result = await calculateTotal.run(
    { price: 100 },
    { taxService: mockTaxService }, // Mock dependencies
  );
  expect(result).toBe(110);
});

// 🔄 Integration Testing: Use the full runtime
test("full order flow", async () => {
  const { runTask, dispose } = await run(app);
  const result = await runTask(processOrder, { orderId: "123" });
  expect(result.status).toBe("processed");
  await dispose();
});
```

**Tip**: Start with unit tests (faster, simpler), then add integration tests for critical flows.

### 💡 Pattern 4: Remember to Register

This is easy to forget when you're moving fast:

```typescript
// ✅ The complete pattern
const database = r
  .resource("db")
  .init(async () => connectToDB())
  .build();

const myTask = r
  .task("myTask")
  .dependencies({ database }) // Declare what you need
  .run(async (input, { database }) => {
    // Use it here
  })
  .build();

const app = r
  .resource("app")
  .register([
    database, // ← Don't forget to register!
    myTask,
  ])
  .build();
```

**Think of it this way**: `dependencies` says "I need these things" and `register` says "these things exist". Both are needed!
