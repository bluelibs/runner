## Why Choose BlueLibs Runner?

### What You Get

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with intelligent inference
- **Testability**: Everything is mockable and testable by design
- **Flexibility**: Compose your app however you want
- **Performance**: Built-in caching and optimization
- **Clarity**: Explicit dependencies, no hidden magic
- **Developer Experience**: Helpful error messages and clear patterns

> **runtime:** "Why choose it? The bullets are persuasive. In practice, your 'intelligent inference' occasionally elopes with `any`, and your 'clear patterns' cosplay spaghetti. Still, compared to the alternatives… I've seen worse cults."

## The Migration Path

Coming from Express? No problem. Coming from NestJS? We feel your pain. Coming from Spring Boot? Welcome to the light side.

The beauty of BlueLibs Runner is that you can adopt it incrementally. Start with one task, one resource, and gradually refactor your existing code. No big bang rewrites required - your sanity will thank you.

> **runtime:** "'No big bang rewrites.' Only a series of extremely small bangs that echo for six months. You start with one task; next thing, your monolith is wearing microservice eyeliner. It's a look."
