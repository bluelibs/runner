## What Is This Thing?

BlueLibs Runner is a TypeScript-first framework that embraces functional programming principles while keeping dependency injection simple enough that you won't need a flowchart to understand your own code. Think of it as the anti-framework framework – it gets out of your way and lets you build stuff that actually works.

### The Core

- **Tasks are functions** - Your business logic, nicely packaged with dependency injection
- **Resources are singletons** - Database connections, configs, services – things that live for your app's lifetime
- **Events are just events** - Decouple parts of your app so they can talk without tight coupling
- **Hooks are lightweight listeners** - React to events without the overhead of full tasks
- **Middleware** - Add cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth, caching) without cluttering your business logic
- **Everything is async** - Built for modern JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Explicit beats implicit** - You'll always know what's happening and why
- **Type-safe by default** - Catch mistakes at compile time, not at 3am in production

## Show Me the Magic

**Here's what "zero magic" looks like in practice:**

```typescript
//  ONE LINE to add caching with TTL
const getUser = r
  .task("users.get")
  .middleware([cache.with({ ttl: 60000 })]) // ← That's it. 1 minute cache.
  .run(async (id) => db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id))
  .build();

//  ONE LINE to add retry with exponential backoff
const callAPI = r
  .task("api.call")
  .middleware([retry.with({ retries: 3, backoff: "exponential" })]) // ← Auto-retry failures
  .run(async (url) => fetch(url))
  .build();

//  ONE LINE to add authentication
const adminAction = r
  .task("admin.action")
  .middleware([auth.with({ role: "admin" })]) // ← Blocks non-admins
  .run(async () => "Secret admin stuff")
  .build();

//  Testing is actually pleasant
test("getUser works", async () => {
  const result = await getUser.run("user-123", { db: mockDb }); // ← Just call it
  expect(result.name).toBe("John");
});
```

**The magic? There isn't any.** It's just clean, composable functions.

## Performance at a Glance

**Runner is FAST.** Here are real benchmarks from an M1 Max:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Operation                           │ Ops/Second    │ Time/Op      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Basic task execution                │ 2.2M          │ ~0.0005 ms   │
│ Task with 5 middlewares             │ 244K          │ ~0.004 ms    │
│ Resource initialization             │ 59.7K         │ ~0.017 ms    │
│ Event emission + handling           │ 245K          │ ~0.004 ms    │
│ 10-level dependency chain           │ 8.4K          │ ~0.12 ms     │
│ Cache middleware (hit)              │ 8M            │ ~0.000125 ms │
└─────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┘

Overhead Analysis:
├─ Middleware overhead:  ~0.00026 ms per middleware (virtually zero)
├─ DI overhead:         ~0.001 ms (compile-time safety pays off)
├─ Memory footprint:    ~3.3 MB per 100 components
└─ Cache speedup:       3.65x faster (automatic optimization)
```

**What this means for you:**

- **Instant feedback** - Tests run in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Lower cloud costs** - Handle more requests with fewer resources
- **Production ready** - Battle-tested at scale (see [Performance](#performance) for details)
